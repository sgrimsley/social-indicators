## Progress updates

Much of the early work will involve collecting and evaluating data, before the first line of code is written.  This log will record that progress, because it wouldn't be apparent otherwise.

### 2014-11-28

Completed:
* Downloaded technical documentation for the Decennial Census (SF3)
* Downloaded standard design error factors for all states (Table C) - for calculating standard error
* Downloaded geography files for all states

To do:
* Identify tables for educational attainment, poverty status, population (P4), and income (from SF3, Ch. 3)
* Identify file name for the relevant tables (from SF3, Figure 2-2).  Download files for each state.
* Evaluate geography file for relevant fields (from SF3, Figure 2-5).
* Identify initial geographic summary regions of interest (city, congressional district, etc).
* Explore whether PUMS data is more appropriate than summary data (was not for TIF project, but may be here)
